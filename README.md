# C++17 in Detail source code

## Introduction

Unofficial source code for Bart≈Çomiej Filipek's excellent [C++17 In Detail](https://leanpub.com/cpp17indetail) book. I've reproduced it here as it's easier to reference and use it from version control.

## License

As per the book, the license for the source is Creative Commons, but it's not specified which of the CC licenses is applied, so I presume it's the basic attribution license (CC BY).
